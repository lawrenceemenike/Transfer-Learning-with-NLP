# Transfer-Learning-with-NLP
Using pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub with tf.keras for text classification. ransfer learning makes it possible to save training resources and to achieve good model generalization even when training on a small dataset. In this project, we will demonstrate this by training with several different TF-Hub modules.

# Objectives
Use various pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub
Perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on your own text data
Visualize model performance metrics with TensorBoard
